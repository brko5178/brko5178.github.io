# Background
  Hi, my name is Brandon Kohrt! I originally graduated from CU Boulder in 2023 with a degree in neuroscience and one in psychology. I currently work as a research assistant for the The Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development study, which is a nationwide longitudinal study that is looking at the brain development of adolescents aged 10-20. 
  
I started in the University of Colorado Boulder Computer Science Program program to learn some skills to help me in research and because I was very interested in software engineering and will be graduating in August of 2025. I hope to combine my previous neuro/psych experience with the CU Boulder Computer Science Program to work in the healthcare technology space or go to graduate school for computational neuroscience! 
 

# Purpose
This page serves as a personal website to showcase some of my past and current projects, and particularly focuses on my project for my last computer science class: Professional Development!

This class is focusing on a self-selected project. I have chosen to do a research project using data from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD)
study focusing on gifted and talented children and thier alchohol and drug use habits. Below is a blog detailing my progress on the project each week
and is still a work in progress! Eventually, I will post any results I find as well as a research paper of my findings.

# Week 1:
      Website is up and running :)

# Week 2:
      Last week we began the course, so I took so time to take the syllabus quiz and read through the 
      course and expectations. I also started thinking about some ideas for the project. My number one 
      idea is to use my access to data I have through my job as a research assistant for the Adolescent 
      Brain and Cognitive Development Study (ABCD). 
      
      Essentially, this is a longitudinal study that follows the same 12,000 participants every year from 
      ages 10-20. The study is still in the data collection phase and most participants are now 17-19, but 
      many papers (more than 1300!) have been uploaded with the data that has been collected thus far. My 
      job involves working with participants and collecting the data and uploading it to a very large database 
      that scientists from around the world can apply to use!

      
      Recently, I also got access to the data for the the latest data release, and this class is a perfect 
      reason to do a side project with the data and practice my data analysis skills. I am still figuring 
      out exactly what I want to look at, but I think drug and alcohol use will be what I want to focus on. 
      This is a very large and complex dataset, so I think it will provide a good amount 
      of work and help me apply to graduate school in the future or apply for a job!

      
      This week I will continue working on my website github page and start focusing in on what my project will look at.

# Week 3:
      Last week I really decided what to do my project on. I would like to look at correlations between success 
      in school and substance use particularly in the group of kids who are labeled "gifted" or "talented". I will         
      also be using the ABCD Study data I have access to.

      This week I woked on and turned in my project proposal which outlined the project, my goals, what I will 
      personally get out of it, and measurable acheivements for the project. 

      A relatively short update this week, but I plan to start wokring on the project 
      in the upcoming week which will have a more substantive update!

# Week 4:
      Last week I completed my project proposal and submitted it for review and zeroed in on what I want to focus on for my research project.
      
      This week, I peer reviewed other projects in the class and reviewed my own feedback. I have tweaked my research question 
      and will be focusing on children who are in gifted and talented programs in school, thier sucesss in school, and if there
      is any correlation in their success in school with the use of drugs and alcohol. My hypothesis is that students labeled gifted and talented
      who do not do well in school will have increased subsatance use compared to gited and talented students who do succeed in school. It may also 
      be a good idea to compare students who are not in gifted and talented programs as well. This week I also started looking into the drove ABCD data.
      My biggest blocker is all of the datasets do not have easy-to-read names, so I have been emailing with a colleague who works in processing the data 
      to point me in the direction I need.

# Week 5:
      Last week I worked a lot more on my personal website and made sure to get a lot more of the 
      necessary information on to it including my resume, contact information, and a solid introduction and explanation of the           
      website along with my blog. In the future I would like to separate some of these things into different pages on my website 
      and get some better html/css going so that the website looks more professional!

      This week I am doing a literature review of gifted and talented students as well as substance use papers from the ABCD study. 
      This will help me get a better idea of the types of statistical analyses that are common for these types of papers. It will 
      also be important to see if I am looking at a new question in the research or if I will be trying to confirm or refute previous findings. 
      This will also help when I go to write up the results in a paper so I can stay consistent with my formatting.

      It will take a while to sort through all of the papers and then also read the ones that I choose, which is the only thing in my way at the moment.

      I think I am doing a good job so far of doing manageable chunks of the project and staying on top of my pseudo-schedule 

# Week 6:
      Last week I completed a literature review of several different papers regarding substance use in the ABCD Study, 
      School Success, and Gifted and Talented Children. I learned a lot regarding the research that has been        
      conducted so far in these fields, the types of analysis that are often done, and what my research question is fulfilling 
      in the grand scheme of things.

      This week I started working on a python script that will allow my to import data from an excel file from the ABCD data 
      and sort it based on the kids who are listed as GT or not. This will allow me to put together a         
      dataset that consists only of the questions and answers I care about and will be neatly separated into GT and non-GT groups. 
      The goal is that I will be able to do this with any survey results from an ABCD source.

      I feel my process for this was good. I have a decent amount of experience working with data 
      at this point, and the format of the data is all very consistent. I should add in a way 
      to check for any errors during processing if one of the surveys is set up differently just in case.

      One thing in my way is that the data repository website is currently under maintenance , so if there 
      is any extra piece of data I want to look at that I did not originally download, I will have to wait.

# Week 7: MID SEMESTER UPDATE
      Original Goal:

     To put together a complete research project using data from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) 
     study focusing on success in school and any correlation that may have with the use of alcohol, cigarettes, and other drugs. 
     This will allow me to show employers or graduate schools that I can collect, process, and analyze data as well as produce 
     a clean and correct research paper. This will help hone data analysis skills as I will be working with a very 
     large dataset and utilize python libraries like numpy and pandas for processing and analysis.

     Updates:

     First, I have decided that I will compare 4 groups: gifted and talented (GT) students who do well and school, 
     GT kids who have not done well in school, and kids not labeled GT who have and have not done well in school as well. 
     This way I will be able to compare the GT and non-GT groups to themselves as well as across the groups GT to non-GT 
     kids to see both if success in school mediates drug and alcohol use and if being a GT kid modifies that outcome as well. 
     I have settled on putting my code into a jupyter notebook for easy viewing and segmented code that can run independently 
     in their blocks. Other than that, my project remains the same with the goal of creating a complete research paper at the end of the term.

      Accomplishments so far:

     Thus far, I have been able to figure out what variables I need to use for my analysis which includes deciding how to numerically 
     encode success in school as well as drug and alcohol use. I have created a code block in my notebook that takes in a 
     csv file from the ABCD study and separates out the participants who have been indicated as being GT and those who have 
     not and puts them into a dataframe. This will allow me to process different survey sets and their answers. This way I 
     can be more flexible. I have done some EDA looking at the number of kids that are labeled GT as well as gender breakdowns. 

     To-do:

     What I need to do in the coming weeks includes doing statistical analysis and writing up the results. To do this, I will 
     review some of the papers I have read and look at the types of statistics they have used to draw their conclusions and 
     apply them to my own data using a python library like numpy or sci-kit which I have experience in. Lastly, 
     I will write up the results using APA format as is standard for many of these papers.
     
# Week 8:
      Last week I put together a sort of ETL pipeline for the surveys that I wanted to look at in the study to help me sort 
      them into the GT groups and non-GT groups. This will help me quantify their substance use and success in school. 

      This week I am planning to run my statistics on my data. I first want to run tests within groups looking to 
      see differences in substance use and school success in general. Then I can look between groups for                
      differences between the GT and non-GT kids. 

      Next week will depend on if I get significant results or not. If I do, I will then start looking at creating 
      a mixed model that is more well suited for longitudinal data. If I do not find anything significant I will       
      either tweak my research question or try looking at some different surveys.

      My biggest issue right now is that I am in the middle of moving, so my internet has been spotty at best, but 
      should be getting all settled in this weekend and will be able to work more on  my project!
      
# Week 9:
       Last week I got my data prepared for analysis which involved creating different dataframes 
       based on the variables I actually want to look at. I also have split them up based on timepoint, 
       so that if I want to just look at a single timepoint I can do that.

      This week I am actually doing some data analysis. I am planning to start with the most recent timepoint
      available which is the 3 year follow or the participants' fourth visit since the baseline. I feel this 
      gives me a better chance to find significant results since there is a higher chance more participants 
      have used drugs and alcohol and have spent more time in school.

      No blocks right now besides time. I will not be able to get to this until the weekend 
      and will have limited time as well, so this may bleed into next week.
      
# Week 10:
      Last week I finished cleaning my data and ensuring all my datasets are ready to go. I also started working on the statistical analysis.

      This week I finished doing some preliminary statistics, but did not find any significant results :(. Not to fret, 
      I am going to go and look at the datasets and maybe change my research question and go from there. And since 
      I have a decent data pipeline it should not be a huge under taking. Also, I may still continue through with my 
      original plan and finish it up and write about my lack of results as well.
      
# Week 11:
      Last week, I did my initial data analysis and did not find significant results. This week, I dug into it 
      a little bit more. I found a very weak correlation between the variables I was looking at, and took a 
      look at some big picture parts of my data. I think the main problem I have come across is that the data
      I am using is from participants aged 10-13. According to what I have read, there is very low exposure 
      to substances at this age and the potential for using them is much lower than ages, say, 14-17. 
      So, it is not all that surprising that I did not find a strong correlation. However, of participants 
      that used any drugs or alcohol, the GT kids' grades were significantly lower than the non-gt kids. 
      So, I think taking all these things into account, if I can get data from more recent timepoints, 
      which I do not currently have access to, there may be a better chance to find a stronger correlation 
      between grades and substance use in these groups! I think for this project though, I will have to 
      focus on the lack of significant results in my report.
      
# Week 12:
      Last week I finished my analysis and started writing up my report. I am starting with the methods 
      section and then will do results and discussion, so I can create a concise abstract and introduction. 
      This week I will continue working on the methods and start on the results and conclusion sections. 
      There are no blockers in my way besides getting myself to actually write.
      
# Week 13:
      Last week I started writing my report, and this week I have finished my report! It can be found here. I also Finished 
      my Final project report for the CSPB class as well
