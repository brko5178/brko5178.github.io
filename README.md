This webpage serves as a log for all the work Brandon Kohrt has and will be doing in CU Boulder's Professional Development in Computer Science class.

# Week 1:
      Website is up and running :)

# Week 2:
      Last week we began the course, so I took so time to take the syllabus quiz and read through the 
      course and expectations. I also started thinking about some ideas for the project. My number one 
      idea is to use my access to data I have through my job as a research assistant for the Adolescent 
      Brain and Cognitive Development Study (ABCD). If you would like to learn
      more about the study itself you can look at this link.
      
      Essentially, this is a longitudinal study that follows the same 12,000 participants every year from 
      ages 10-20. The study is still in the data collection phase and most participants are now 17-19, but 
      many papers (more than 1300!) have been uploaded with the data that has been collected thus far. My 
      job involves working with participants and collecting the data and uploading it to a very large database 
      that scientists from around the world can apply to use!

      
      Recently, I also got access to the data for the the latest data release, and this class is a perfect 
      reason to do a side project with the data and practice my data analysis skills. I am still figuring 
      out exactly what I want to look at, but I think drug and alcohol use will be what I want to focus on. 
      This is a very large and complex dataset, so I think it will provide a good amount 
      of work and help me apply to graduate school in the future or apply for a job!

      
      This week I will continue working on my website github page and start focusing in on what my project will look at.

# Week 3:
      Last week I really decided what to do my project on. I would like to look at correlations between success in school and substance use particularly in the group of kids who are labeled "gifted" or "talented". I will also be using the ABCD Study data I have access to.

      This week I woked on and turned in my project proposal which outlined the project, my goals, what I will personally get out of it, and measurable acheivements for the project. 

      A relatively short update this week, but I plan to start wokring on the project in the upcoming week which will have a more substantive update!
